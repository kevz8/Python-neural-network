# Python-neural-network

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a neural network using Python. The code is inspired by the tutorial available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kft1AJ9WVDk. The network is designed to perform a simple binary classification task.


## Features
- A simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer
- Sigmoid activation function for both hidden and output layers
- Backpropagation algorithm for training

# Code Explanation
## Neural Network Class

# Initialization:

- Defines the network architecture with one hidden layer.
- Initializes weights and biases with random values and zeros, respectively.

# Backpropagation Method:

- Updates weights and biases based on the error between the predicted output and the true output.
- Uses the gradient of the sigmoid function to adjust weights.
